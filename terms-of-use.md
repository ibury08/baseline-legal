**Last updated:** 2025-12-12

## 1. Introduction
These Terms and Conditions apply to the Baseline app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Ian Bury (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a **Freemium** service.

By downloading or using the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you read them carefully before using the Application.

## 2. License and Intellectual Property
The Service Provider grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install, and use the Application strictly in accordance with these Terms.

The Application itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, belong to the Service Provider. You are not allowed to copy or modify the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks in any way. You may not attempt to extract the source code of the Application, and you also shouldn't try to translate the Application into other languages or make derivative versions.

## 3. User Content and Data
The Application is designed to operate locally on your device. Any content, data, or information you create or input into the Application ("User Data") remains stored on your device. The Service Provider does not access, store, or claim ownership of your User Data. You are solely responsible for backing up your User Data (e.g., via iCloud or iTunes backups). The Service Provider is not liable for any loss of data resulting from the deletion of the Application or device failure.

## 4. Restrictions
You agree not to, and you will not permit others to:
* License, sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute, transmit, host, outsource, disclose, or otherwise commercially exploit the Application.
* Modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, decrypt, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Application.
* Use the Application for any illegal purpose or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law.

## 5. Subscriptions, Free Trials, and Payments

### 5.1 Paid Subscriptions
The Application is offered on a subscription basis (the "Subscription") for access to premium features. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as monthly or annually), depending on the Subscription plan you select.

### 5.2 Free Trials
The Application may, at the Service Provider's discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period. If you sign up for a free trial, you may be required to provide your payment details. You will not be charged until the free trial period has expired. **On the last day of the free trial period, unless you canceled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you selected.**

### 5.3 Auto-Renewal and Cancellation
Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or the Service Provider cancels it. You must cancel the auto-renewal through your App Store Account Settings at least 24 hours before the end of the current Subscription period. Deleting the Application does not cancel your Subscription.

### 5.4 Purchases and Refunds
All purchases are handled by Apple's App Store. The Service Provider does not have access to your payment information. Refunds are governed by the terms set by Apple. If you wish to request a refund, you must contact Apple directly.

## 6. Updates and Modifications
The Service Provider is committed to ensuring that the Application is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the Application at any time. We will never change the price of your existing Subscription without providing prior notice, as further detailed in **Section 5. Subscriptions, Free Trials, and Payments.**

## 7. Termination
The Service Provider may terminate use of the Application at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Upon termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; and (b) you must stop using the Application, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

## 8. Warranty Disclaimer
